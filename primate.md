### Primate â€” May, 1998

What is it that makes us do the things we do  
So often asked but most of us have no clue  
From them to us, primitive to new  

_From Lucy to Marilyn Monroe_  
_We did away with stone for computer download_  
_We're moving too fast as if you didn't know_  
_Take it slow, take it slow_  

Thunder roars lightning strikes, it's coming  
The bones are laughing at us  
No need to bother running  

New York city lights, airplane flights  
Music videos and midnight late shows  
A world acting like we didn't come from here  
How long before we live up there
