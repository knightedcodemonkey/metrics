### Abused Man â€” May 31st, 1998

The suns coming up and lights shining through  
It's heading for my face, I don't even move  
What's the use  
I'm use to the abuse  

_I get so aggravated_  
_I know that I am hated_  
_Don't even wish me a belated_  
_Damn, I feel so degraded_  

At my shit job again  
The garbage stinks and the clock is dead I think  
I could bear it and grin  
What's the use  
I'm use to the abuse  

Driving home through traffic  
A lane opens to my right  
I hesitate, damn it's too late  
My life's a sorry plight  
What's the use  
I'm use to the abuse  

I'm an abused man, I have no real plan, I'm just an abused man
