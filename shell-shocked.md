### Shell Shocked - August 26th, 2008


I lie and grin trying to find myself again  
Lost and insecure, committing varied sins  
Always trying to be something I'm not  
Dream and scheme, fabricate a plot  

Tortured by a long transition  
How did I get in this position  
I'm a fast thinker who anticipates  
Preempt the conversation on every date  

I can hardly believe this is me  
My future's uncertain and in jeopardy  
Where do you turn when there's nowhere to hide  
I feign instead of face the pain inside  

_I'm shell-shocked torn and surprised_  
_For my transgressions I indemnify_  
_Underachiever turned believer in my life_  
_The future changes for me tonight!_
