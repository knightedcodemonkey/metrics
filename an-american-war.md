### An American War â€” June 3rd, 1998

The smell of death was strong in the air  
Bullets were flying not far from here  
In pursuit of the enemy  
Strangers on foreign land, in need of a remedy  
Who will die for their country  

_Holding their ground, trembling with fear_  
_Waiting to come home to whom they hold dear_  
_We've seen this before_  
_It's an American war, an American war_  
_The battle is ending it's almost won_  
_Fighting with courage and strength, our side will never run_  
_We've seen this before_  
_It's an American war, an American war_  

Like a heavy snowstorm crossfire filled the air  
We raped the enemy until she was dead and bare  
Red, white, and blue was full of pride  
Men keep up the attack with a confident stride  
This is the darkest side of man  

The front line is holding strong  
The sun should be up before long  
Surrounded by death  
He asked him to stay by his side till his final breath  
Can God be found in such a place
