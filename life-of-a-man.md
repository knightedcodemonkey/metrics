### Life of a Man â€” June 14th, 1998

Fully loaded fridge stacked with beer  
This was the thought on his mind with no other care  
The sun was shining, sky was clear  
The weekend was here  

Parked next to him at the light she was quite a sight  
Could there be sex in store for him tonight  
Only time could tell  
He'd give it a shot, what the hell  

Alone in his world, he had no fear  
Turning the channels and downing the beer  
Work was work, play was play  
He needed a woman who saw things his way  
His hands were rough and his nails dirty  
Showing signs of baldness at the age of thirty  

_Never show the world your tears_  
_Protect and serve with no fears_  
_Provide for your family as planned_  
_Live the life of a man_  

Working for a real asshole trying to move up in life  
Vacation time couldn't come soon enough  
Dad taught him to gut fish with his knife  

Divorced and on his second marriage  
His baby girl was sleeping in her carriage  
No longer did he search for other women  
Just lost the desire  
He's a family man and stopped being a liar
