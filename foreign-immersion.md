### Foreign Immersion — September 27th, 2008

I want to lie out on the beach  
And let the sun shine on my face  
Then surf the waves before I swim beneath  
To resurface with a woman at my place  

Immerse ourselves in another culture  
Come with me to see the exotic  
And together our spirits we can nurture  
Over foreign elixirs that transcend hypnotic  

_I want it; I need it — this taste of freedom_  
_To stop the inside bleeding_  
_Give me something more, show me a world_  
_Where passions ignite, dreams do take flight_  
_And the man on the corner doesn't exist_  
_Just sunrise on the horizon_  
_In the morning as I'm rising_  
_From a night of orgasmic bliss_  

Whether it be Mexico or somewhere I don't know  
It doesn't matter I just want to go  
To places I've never seen before  
And find a girl that I adore ...
