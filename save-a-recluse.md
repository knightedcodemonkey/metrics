### Save a recluse â€” September 3rd, 2008

Sitting quietly in an open space  
Gazing upon a garden out of place  
People post flyers trying to connect  
I'm still alone and a hopeless wreck  

_The solitude has made me uneasy_  
_I regret putting people beneath me_  
_I want to meet someone_  
_I want to have some fun_
_It can last one night or for life if it's right_
_I'm getting bored with myself_
_I want to rejoice in somebody else_
_Rejoice in somebody else_

Perched above the masses below  
I can pass judgment and turn shallow  
My outlook's become skewed  
My perception of people so screwed  

Be it friend, foe, mentor or aide  
Let's get together and promenade  
I used to socialize and thrive but I gave it up  
Solve your own problems I've heard enough  

Turned full circle to a new understanding  
I'm tired ... I'm done, enough with the damning  
So let's hit the pub to drink and get loose  
Share some of your soul, save a recluse
