### Subatomic What â€” May, 1998

Like a proton spinning out of control  
I'm crashing against the force  
You'll see me falling out the door  
Too many down the hatch to drive the Porsche  

Like an atom bomb going off  
I'm about to explode  
So many people are around  
Particles and moving energy how profound  

_Subatomic what_  
_Subatomic what_  
_Pass the tonic and shut up_  
_Subatomic what_

Like a neutron pulled by gravity I'm getting sucked in  
It's no dream just a hopeless scheme  
Anybody else want a shot at me
