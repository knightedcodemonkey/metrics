### Invasion â€” June 4th, 1998

He's the man that was gonna die  
He's the man that had E. Coli  
I'm afraid to breathe anymore  
Wouldn't dare share a Coca-Cola  
I'm too terrifed of Ebola  

Will we ever find an answer  
Her baby daughter was cursed with cancer  
How many of us live with a virus  
AIDS is a worldwide epidemic  
Somebody better think quick  

_We're being invaded_  
_Soon Homo Sapiens will be outdated_  
_It's the microscopic world_  
_The diagnosis is in_  
_We're plagued, it's us they live within_  
_We've been infected_  

There's a small African village in hysteria  
The mosquito has arrived that carries malaria  
Hopefully we rise to the occasion  
Beware the world of minute measure  
They've started their invasion
