### Tortured Friendship â€” September 12th, 2008

Our life as roommates doesn't fit  
There's tension over our past  
Put simply without bombast  
We have a tortured friendship  

Please don't get me wrong  
I'd value a true friendship  
But not "fuck you, fuck this"  
We just can't seem to get along  

_You know the relationship ended_  
_So when I see other girls_  
_Don't get upended_  
_You know the relationship ended_  
_So when I ask you to leave_  
_Don't get offended_  

Sometimes it seems possible 
I almost think we can do it  
Then you speak out illogical  
OCD should have knew it  

Vying for love unreciprocated  
And secret wishes intimated  
Roommates with a tortured friendship  
Our bad karma must have sent it
