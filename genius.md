### Genius August 27th, 2008

Travel to the top of a skyscraper  
Realized blueprints transformed from paper  
Somewhere among us there walks a creator  
Someone to enhance our lives, an innovator  

_Like a sinusoidal cosine_  
_Periods of genius repeat in time_  
_Their elusive thoughts escape most minds_  
_To have that insight would be sublime_  

Enter a room and flip a light switch  
An idea's been summoned from respite  
Someone among us is meant to inspire  
Someone profound we can admire  

Use a cell phone and chat a bit  
Satellites traverse an ellipse in orbit  
Somewhere among us there's a prodigy  
Someone who's alone, an oddity  

There's some genius in us all  
Sometimes we succeed, other times we fall  
But there exists a rare few  
Who comprehend more than we do  

Their genius will trump you and me  
It can't escape its destiny ...
