### Ego â€” September 5th, 2008

On a regular basis I get the look  
It's an open invitation  
To use a clever line  
And nullify masturbation  

_I want a blonde-haired, blue-eyed honey_  
_To complement my style_  
_And laugh when I'm funny_  

_Stay by my side when I'm down and low_  
_I'll find solace in the seeds we sow_  

_Don't notice looks from other girls_  
_I'm too lost inside your world_  

Usually I don't even care  
But then once in a while  
I'll respond to her stare  
And look back with a smile  

I'm an object of affection  
Beautiful girls look in my direction  
From the outside they like what they see  
Approach then, and know the better part of me
