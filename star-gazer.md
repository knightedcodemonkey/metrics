### Star Gazer â€” July 5th, 1998

Possibilities of alien life  
It kept his mind in constant strife  
He would be there for the midnight flight  
He proclaimed, the universe entropy  
It cannot stop me  

Bound for a crash course in reality  
He was confined to only visions in his mind  
To earth he was contained  
Where to put the blame  
His meager human brain  

Who will miss him  
He's off to a new solar system  
The journey is on  
He travels far and beyond  
Gazing at the heavens since childhood  
Up there he'll finally be understood  

_I am what I am_  
_I've dreamt of little green men_  
_I am a stargazer_  
_Beware my Vulcan triple-beam laser_
