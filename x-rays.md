### X-Rays â€” June 5th, 1998

Can I be seen through  
Are the ideas in my head easily seen by you  
Am I being X-rayed, am I becoming invisible  
How is it you know I feel miserable  
What's up with me today  

_I don't want to be on display, I don't want to be X-rayed_  
_I feel awkward and strange today, like I'm under an X-ray_  
_It shouldn't be used that way_  

What else will man invent to get paid  
The future world is coming  
Are we that blind to the truth  
It can't be stopped, so what's the use  
Some other worlds use X-rays  

His skeleton was in full view  
They had more in mind than collecting dues  
They had control of the X-ray
Today a genius will be born  
Years after Jesus wore a crown of thorns  
Ask him the secret of X-rays
