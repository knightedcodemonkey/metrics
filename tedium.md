### Tedium â€” September 25th, 2008

_I'm living far removed from dreams_  
_My life has been misplaced_  
_Let's rendezvous at a foreign place_  
_So our lives can be exchanged_  
_Yours for mine_  
_And destiny can get it right this time_  

I'm buried by life's cruel monotony  
Selfish routine piled on top of me  
I want to scream just to feel alive  
Don't you live before you die!?  

Real life resides somewhere higher  
On top of mountains and under fire  
When I close my eyes and reflect  
That life and mine finally connect  

On the train, then off the train  
A combination that drains  
Trapped by a daily commute  
Weary souls mix and dilute  

I feel my life slipping away  
What's the point of today  
If it feels more like tomorrow  
Your excitement for my sorrow  

A pigeon perched high above  
While men in suits discuss love  
I've seen this all before  
My life's routine is just a bore
