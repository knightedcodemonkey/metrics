### Just a Thought â€” June 2rd, 1998

Mother nature is never predictable  
Sometimes you could say life is dull  
We taste the good Lord on Sunday  
I hate roads that only go one way  

_So I keep things to myself_  
_As the seasons change with time_  
_I know I'm like everyone else_  
_We all like songs that rhyme_  
_Ones that stay in the mind_  

Ultraviolet light is out of normal sight  
Could there really be a God  
And if so does he sleep at night  
I want a woman with one hell of a bod'  

Does anybody have the right to judge  
Who says when to pull the plug  
Women shouldn't pick up hitchhikers  
And that Oprah, I don't really like her
