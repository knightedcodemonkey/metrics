### Come My Way â€” September 17th, 2008

When is love going to come my way  
You're a stranger I think of every day  
One good man with an open heart  
My cynicism is tearing it apart  

Only dreams conjure your essence  
Hold my hand and give me a kiss  
Resist your evanescence  
Grant my heart this one last wish  

I just want to know who you are  
So we can start our life together  
My better half, I'll love you forever  

_I just want to find you, and look into your eyes_  
_To see the surprise of finding me too_    

_I just want to find you, so I can be complete_  
_And bring you relief by finding me too_
