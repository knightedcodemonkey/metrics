### Rhetoric â€” July 11th, 1998

So many lines had been written  
Shared thoughts were ruled forbidden  
And I could give a damn  
As if it really matters  
Prepared platters thrown through windows shatter  

Discrepancies unfold between young and old  
Don't scream your nonsense over here  
Dissected mind, rhetoric written in rhyme  
Making sense of this will be hard fought  
So I won't give it too much thought  

Give me room to breathe  
I need to be alive please  
Am I worthlessness gone amiss  
Brain outbursts are running dry  
My inspirations soon will die  

_It all had been thought up_  
_Children do wrong, children get caught up_  
_It's all gone to waste_  
_Long lost visions will be misplaced_  

_This rhetoric of mind_  
_Will it be valued in time_  
_To each his own_  
_And to the king, his goddamn throne_
