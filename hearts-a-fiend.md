### Heart's a Fiend â€” August 29th, 2008

Your beauty and grace  
It's heaven to behold  
As you walk at an angel's pace  

You're much too hard to ignore  
You touch me like no one before  

Oh if I could hold you tight  
To look in your eyes  
And know the feelings right  

_I wonder if it's meant to be_  
_At times I sit and dream_  
_That one day you'll be with me_  
_For now your love's unseen ..._  
_For now my heart's a fiend_  

Since you told me no  
I've tried to let go  
But for you and only you  
There's no limit to the lengths I'll go  
To express these feelings I have to show  

There's no way for me to say  
How I feel in this moment  
And every single day  

For now my feelings reside  
Deep down, and trapped inside
